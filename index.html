    <h4>Origins</h4>

        <p class = "TEXTL">I have always loved creating things. I loved crafting things and drawing things. Sometimes these things were made to benefit me. Sometimes they were for fun, but more often than not, I just stopped and never finished them. Chatterboxes was created to benefit me, I made it for fun, and I stuck with it.
        <br>
        I created Chatterboxes because I wanted a way to communicate with friends even when we weren’t together in person. Google slides is great because many people can edit it at the same time. So I created a slideshow. I don’t remember exactly how I came up with the name Chatterboxes but once I thought of it I knew it was what it needed to be called.
        <br>
        The slideshow was created on pi day of 2024. I wasn’t even sure if any of my friends would go on. More and more doubt was setting on me, maybe it was a stupid idea. Then my friend Liz got on. After that I invited more and more people and many of them really liked it. It became more than I ever thought it would.

    <h4>The Entities</h4>

        <p class = "TEXTR">When Liz first came on it only took her a few minutes to completely change the entire future of Chatterboxes. Honestly I shouldn’t be surprised. She put a stupid joke up on the front slide. Cheeze goblin has eaten all the cheeze. This leads into a fun game of trying to get the cheeze back.
        <br>
        Soon another character appears, a rival to Cheeze Goblin: Warble. Warble starts off as a fun little cute dude who is trying to steal the attention from Cheeze Goblin. This led into a much larger fight that became the first season of Chatterboxes.
        <br>
        Throughout this season more and more entities started popping up, making it very apparent that we were going all in and moving past the stages of just a group chat. Soon, everyone had their own entity.

    <h4>The RPG</h4>
    
    <div class="two-column">
      
      <div class="text-column">
        
        <p class = "TEXTL">RPG stands for role playing game (and also a very dangerous weapon but that isn’t important). Some common examples of RPGs are games like Dungeons and Dragons. There are many video games with turn based combat that are referred to as RPGs although there are also many called RPGs that don’t have turn based combat. Anyway the definition of what makes a game an RPG is a little loose, so it was easy to call Chatterboxes one.
        <br>  
        After season 1 ended we launched into a second season. Then a third one. We kept making more seasons with connected storylines and advancing the lore of the universe. Because of this, even though we still sometimes chatted on it, Chatterboxes became more story based. This is what led us to call it a RPG.

    <h4>Addtions</h4>
    
    <p>Though Chatterboxes started off very simple, over time more and more things were added. These things were: the calendar, the news stand, the lore tower, the map of the universe, and the library of lore. There are other slides but they are underused or not very important, so these will be the additions we will be looking at.</p>

        <p class = "TEXTR">
          The newsstand started very early on in the history of Chatterboxes. In the first season Mono started gathering information to help defeat Cheeze Goblin. After season one it stuck around under new ownership, Mono’s son Stereo. Every day the news gets updated to make sure people understand what's going on. Currently it’s being run by Neon at his megacorp.

        <p class = "TEXTL">A calendar seems like a really simple thing, but it has become quite important. It started as just a place to post things that were happening in your life. Eventually we started marking what day it was too. The biggest use of the calendar is that we use it to post the names of the daily episodes.

        <p class = "TEXTR">
          The lore tower is similar to the news stand but it is not maintained as well. It was intended to help people understand the complicated lore. Unfortunately no one kept it running well so there was no information.

      <div class="text-column">

        <p class = "TEXTL">The map of the universe is an unfinished document that displays the different places in the universe. All of the places that have been visited are there and some that have never been encountered are there too. It has detailed information on these places.

      <div class="text-column">

        <p class = "TEXTR">
          The final major component is the library of lore. The library of lore is a place where people put links to documents that contain stories about the universe or entities. People also put links to documents that explain rules to how the universe works.
